# Tic-Tac-Toe

STATE!!!!! 

This project was by far the hardest for me to conceptualize. I could wrap my brain around using code to build a tic-tac-toe board. I understood how to make an X or an O appear on click. That all made sense.

But how in the world was I going to make the code evaluate whether one player has one the game? I wrote a function that checks whether one of the applicable win conditions had been met by either player and call that function each time a piece is placed on the board.

This was also a fun project for me to further my understanding of Bootstrap, frontend frameworks, and styling in general. I implemented a linear-gradient for the background with CSS and used bootstraps column system to form the gameboard itself. I learned a lot on this project and I am proud of what I accomplished.

Please take a look and let me know if you have any advice/questions!
